"""Phase 2 ML Extensions: Learning-based research intelligence (Modules 10-13).

This package extends ARIS with machine learning capabilities:
- SciBERT role induction (Module 10)
- Domain ontology clustering (Module 11)
- Embedding-based hypothesis generation (Module 12)
- Semantic role labeling (Module 13)

Phase 2 modules operate exclusively through:
- Explicit tool interfaces
- Hypothesis proposal mechanisms
- Reasoning + evaluation gates

Phase 2 is OPTIONAL and does not affect Phase 1 core behavior.
